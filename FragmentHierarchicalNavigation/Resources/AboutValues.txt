The application was designed for english and spanish.  English will be 
considered the default, and thusly all English translations will be placed in
the Values folder.  The Spanish translation should be placed in the Values-es
folder.  All English strings should contain an analogous Spanish string.

In addition, the Values folder should contain value files common to all 
language qualified Values folders.  Those common files should not be contained
in any of the qualified folders.
