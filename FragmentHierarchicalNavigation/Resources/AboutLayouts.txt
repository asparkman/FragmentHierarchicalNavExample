The application is designed for devices that meet the following qualifiers.
	1. large-land (large landscape)
	2. large-port (large non-landscape)
	3. normal-land (normal landscape)
	4. normal-port (normal non-landscape)
The Layout folder does not serve to be a default for the four qualified 
folders.  The Layout folder should house views and layouts that are common to 
each.  In this sense, all items in the Layout folder should not be contained in
the qualified layout folders.  During development it should not be used as a 
round-about way to bury multiple screen size handling until later.
